## 🧠 Bot's Blueprint: How It Ticks

1. 📜 Initialization starts with the bot unfurling various JSON scrolls containing the lore for the flex messages.
2. 🚪 Upon a knock (POST request) at the `callback` gateway, the bot scrutinizes the visitor's signature.
3. 📨 The bot then deciphers the incoming scrolls (events) to seek out message tales.
4. 🎭 Depending on the tale's essence, the bot conjures the fitting flex message as a reply.
5. 🎲 And if the tale is unfamiliar? Brace for a whimsical "Magic 8-Ball" revelation!

## 🚀 Launch Sequence

1. 📦 Acquire this treasure by cloning the repository.
2. 🧙‍♂️ Conjure the required spells with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
